# YTDLChannelArchive

NOTE: YTDL IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING ISSUES WITH DOWNLOAD SPEED, WE ARE WORKING ON ADDING A DIFFERENT PROGRAM TO THIS REPO TO HELP WITH DOWNLOAD SPEED

Use this script to download a list of channels all at once!

Currently only working on Windows. 

Make a channels.txt file in the same dir as the script. download FFMPEG and YTDL

No python deps needed, just install python3 and run!

#How to run

1. Open powershell as admin

2. Navigate to dir where extracted zip is located 

3. type python download.py or python3 download.py depending on configuration

4. Watch the script run!

#Tips and tricks

If you are going to run on a different HDD. use Set-Location D: (where d is your drive letter) to change drives in powershell! Use cd to change directories and ls to show where you currently are

Download file list: add on channel per line for script to work

Notes: if you clone directly from this repo, you will need to download the latest ffmpeg windows binaries, which can be found on ffmpegs website

Disclaimer: In our release package we include the latest version of ffmpeg and ytdl, all rights go to both of these teams, and shoutout to them for creating awesome software!
